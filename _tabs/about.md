Hello there, friend.

My name is Yassir Lassiry, a moroccan software engineering student and cyber security enthusiast.

I recently got really interested in cyber security when a participated in a local CTF event on site, It was my first experience ever and since then something clicked, i was hooked !

That being said, I decided to create a simple blog where I can share what I know and what I'm learning. So, you can expect some ctf writeups, articles, tutorials, challenges and more.

You can find my socials at the bottom left of the screen. Happy coding :)
