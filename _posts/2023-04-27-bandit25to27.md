## Level 25 --> 26

### Level credentials

- username : **<span style="color : #277BE9">bandit25</span>**
- password : **<span style="color : #277BE9">p7TaowMYrmu23Ol8hiZh9UvD0O9hpx8d</span>**

### Level goal

Logging in to bandit26 from bandit25 should be fairly easyâ€¦ The shell for user bandit26 is not /bin/bash, but something else. Find out what it is, how it works and how to break out of it.

### Level solution

As described, this level is pretty much free, an ssh key private key is in the current directory, let's copy it to our local machine and use it to access the next level.

```bash
bandit25@bandit:~$ ls
bandit26.sshkey
```

```bash
# in our host machine
â”Œâ”€â”€(yarissã‰¿Kali-VM)-[~/boxes/bandit]
â””â”€$ scp -P 2220 bandit25@bandit.labs.overthewire.org:/home/bandit25/bandit26.sshkey .
```

```bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(yarissã‰¿Kali-VM)-[~/boxes/bandit]
â””â”€$ ls -l bandit26.sshkey
-rw------- 1 yariss yariss 1679 Apr 27 23:31 bandit26.sshkey
```

Now let's connect to bandit26 !

```bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(yarissã‰¿Kali-VM)-[~/boxes/bandit]
â””â”€$ ssh -i bandit26.sshkey bandit26@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
```

That's odd, we can't connect ! We get logged out each time...
My first thought is `bashrc` being modified.

But, the challenge description says that bandit26 is using another shell !

Let's connect using bandit25 credentials and see what the shell is going on!

```bash
bandit25@bandit:~$ cat /etc/passwd | grep bandit26
bandit26:x:11026:11026:bandit level 26:/home/bandit26:/usr/bin/showtext
```

Hmmm, its seems like a custom shell, let's read its content.

```bash
bandit25@bandit:~$ cat /usr/bin/showtext
#!/bin/sh

export TERM=linux

exec more ~/text.txt
exit 0
```

It seems like the shell executes `more` on `~/text.txt` and when it finished, it exits. The `exit` is the reason we get disconnected.

```bash
bandit25@bandit:~$ ls -l /home/bandit26/text.txt
-rw-r----- 1 bandit26 bandit26 258 Apr 23 18:04 /home/bandit26/text.txt
```

Our text has 258 characters, so what I'm thinking here is, when we log in with bandit26, we must prevent `more` from reading all of `text.txt` content, that way `exit` doesn't get triggered.

It worked, we are not being kicked !
Let's change our shell back to `bash`. but how are we going to do that?

We can access vim inside `more` by just typing `v`, and then inside `vim` we can execute commands.

> Note : hit `ESC` to switch to the command mode

```bash
:set shell=/bin/bash
:shell
```

This sets our shell to `bash`, instead of $SHELL which is not what we want in our case.

`:shell` allows us to open a new `bash` shell inside Vim, which allows us to execute `bash` commands and return to Vim when we're finished.

Here we go, we escaped the broken shell !

```bash
:shell
bandit26@bandit:~$ ls
bandit27-do  text.txt
```

## Level 26 --> 27

### Level credentials

- username : **<span style="color : #277BE9">bandit26</span>**
- password : **<span style="color : #277BE9">SSH KEY from the previous level</span>**

### Level goal

Good job getting a shell! Now hurry and grab the password for bandit27!

### Level solution

After escaping the shell in the previous level, we are now presented with a SUID binary, let's run it.

```bash
bandit26@bandit:~$ ./bandit27-do
Run a command as another user.
  Example: ./bandit27-do id
```

We have exploited something similar to this in the previous levels, we can just display the target's password using this binary.

```bash
bandit26@bandit:~$ ./bandit27-do cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit27
YnQpBuifNMas1hcUFk70ZmqkhUU2EuaS
```

And voila !

We got our password ðŸ˜ƒ
