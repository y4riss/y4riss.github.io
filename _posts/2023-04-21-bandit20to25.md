## Level 20 --> 21

### Level credentials

- username : **<span style="color : #277BE9">bandit20</span>**
- password : **<span style="color : #277BE9">VxCazJaVykI6W36BkBU0mJTCM8rR95XT</span>**

### Level goal

There is a setuid binary in the homedirectory that does the following: it makes a connection to localhost on the port you specify as a commandline argument. It then reads a line of text from the connection and compares it to the password in the previous level (bandit20). If the password is correct, it will transmit the password for the next level (bandit21).

### Level solution

Okey, following the instructions, the `setuid binary` makes a connection to `localhost` on the port that **we specify**.

Meaning that, first, we will need to setup up a server to listen on that port.

As we have seen earlier, `nc` allows us to listen for connections over TCP. let's use it !

```bash
#server
bandit20@bandit:~$ nc -nlvp 1337
Listening on 0.0.0.0 1337
```

Now we need to open another terminal to interact with the server.

> **\*Note**: We could have used a single terminal by running the server on the background, but hey as long as its working who cares right?\*

```bash
#client
bandit20@bandit:~$ ./suconnect 1337
```

Now, the server has to send the current password to the client, let's do it.

```bash
#server
bandit20@bandit:~$ nc -nlvp 1337
Listening on 0.0.0.0 1337
Connection received on 127.0.0.1 45020
VxCazJaVykI6W36BkBU0mJTCM8rR95XT
NvEJF7oVjkddltPSrdKEFOllh9V1IBcq # our password :D
```

```bash
#client
bandit20@bandit:~$ ./suconnect 1337
Read: VxCazJaVykI6W36BkBU0mJTCM8rR95XT
Password matches, sending next password
```

We got our password ðŸ˜ƒ

> NvEJF7oVjkddltPSrdKEFOllh9V1IBcq

## Level 21 --> 22

### Level credentials

- username : **<span style="color : #277BE9">bandit21</span>**
- password : **<span style="color : #277BE9">NvEJF7oVjkddltPSrdKEFOllh9V1IBcq</span>**

### Level goal

A program is running automatically at regular intervals from cron, the time-based job scheduler. Look in /etc/cron.d/ for the configuration and see what command is being executed.

### Level solution

Imagine you are the boss of a big company, and you have a lot of tasks to manage. Some tasks need to be done daily, while others only need to be done once a week or once a month. It would be impossible for you to keep track of all these tasks and make sure they are done on time, every time.

That's where cronjobs come in. You can think of cronjobs as your personal assistant who reminds you to do certain tasks at specific times. Just like your assistant, cronjobs are always working in the background, checking your schedule and making sure everything runs smoothly.

Now in our case, we should look for current cronjobs and inspect them, maybe we can escalate our privileges and get the next password.

We were told to look in `/etc/cron.d`, let's do that.

```bash
bandit21@bandit:~$ cd /etc/cron.d
bandit21@bandit:/etc/cron.d$ ls -lhis
total 36K
67634 4.0K -rw-r--r-- 1 root root  62 Feb 21 22:02 cronjob_bandit15_root
76629 4.0K -rw-r--r-- 1 root root  62 Feb 21 22:02 cronjob_bandit17_root
76634 4.0K -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 120 Feb 21 22:03 cronjob_bandit22
76637 4.0K -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 122 Feb 21 22:03 cronjob_bandit23
76640 4.0K -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 120 Feb 21 22:03 cronjob_bandit24
76652 4.0K -rw-r--r-- 1 root root  62 Feb 21 22:03 cronjob_bandit25_root
  269 4.0K -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 201 Jan  8  2022 e2scrub_all
76677 4.0K -rwx------ 1 root root  52 Feb 21 22:04 otw-tmp-dir
75621 4.0K -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 396 Feb  2  2021 sysstat
```

Hmmm, interesting. Since we are at level 21, and want to move on to level 22, let's look at `cronjob_bandit22` and see what it holds for us.

```bash
bandit21@bandit:/etc/cron.d$ cat cronjob_bandit22
@reboot bandit22 /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit22.sh &> /dev/null
* * * * * bandit22 /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit22.sh &> /dev/null
```

Okey, what the heck is that ? Let me explain.

As we discussed earlier, this is a cronjob entry.

At each `@reboot`, the script `/usr/bin/cronjob_bandit22.sh` will get executed by the user `bandit22`. That's for the first line.

The second line indicates that the same script will be executed each minute `* * * * *`.

Okey, the next natural thing to do here is to inspect that script.

```bash
bandit21@bandit:/etc/cron.d$ cat /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit22.sh
#!/bin/bash
chmod 644 /tmp/t7O6lds9S0RqQh9aMcz6ShpAoZKF7fgv
cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit22 > /tmp/t7O6lds9S0RqQh9aMcz6ShpAoZKF7fgv
```

Using our sherlock skills, the password is clearly being stored under `/tmp` in a file called `t7O6lds9S0RqQh9aMcz6ShpAoZKF7fgv`.

Let's read the file's content.

```bash
bandit21@bandit:/etc/cron.d$ cat /tmp/t7O6lds9S0RqQh9aMcz6ShpAoZKF7fgv
WdDozAdTM2z9DiFEQ2mGlwngMfj4EZff
```

We got our password ðŸ˜ƒ

> WdDozAdTM2z9DiFEQ2mGlwngMfj4EZff

## Level 22 --> 23

### Level credentials

- username : **<span style="color : #277BE9">bandit22</span>**
- password : **<span style="color : #277BE9">WdDozAdTM2z9DiFEQ2mGlwngMfj4EZff</span>**

### Level goal

A program is running automatically at regular intervals from cron, the time-based job scheduler. Look in /etc/cron.d/ for the configuration and see what command is being executed.

**NOTE**: Looking at shell scripts written by other people is a very useful skill. The script for this level is intentionally made easy to read. If you are having problems understanding what it does, try executing it to see the debug information it prints.

### Level solution

If you have passed the previous level and fully grasped the concept, this level should not be that hard.

```bash
bandit22@bandit:~$ cd /etc/cron.d
bandit22@bandit:/etc/cron.d$ ls -lhis
total 36K
67634 4.0K -rw-r--r-- 1 root root  62 Feb 21 22:02 cronjob_bandit15_root
76629 4.0K -rw-r--r-- 1 root root  62 Feb 21 22:02 cronjob_bandit17_root
76634 4.0K -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 120 Feb 21 22:03 cronjob_bandit22
76637 4.0K -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 122 Feb 21 22:03 cronjob_bandit23
76640 4.0K -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 120 Feb 21 22:03 cronjob_bandit24
76652 4.0K -rw-r--r-- 1 root root  62 Feb 21 22:03 cronjob_bandit25_root
  269 4.0K -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 201 Jan  8  2022 e2scrub_all
76677 4.0K -rwx------ 1 root root  52 Feb 21 22:04 otw-tmp-dir
75621 4.0K -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 396 Feb  2  2021 sysstat
```

Let's read `cronjob_bandit23` content.

```bash
@reboot bandit23 /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit23.sh  &> /dev/null
* * * * * bandit23 /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit23.sh  &> /dev/null
```

Okey, `/usr/bin/cronjob_bandit23.sh` is being executed by `bandit23` every minute on the minute.

```bash
bandit22@bandit:/etc/cron.d$ cat /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit23.sh
#!/bin/bash

myname=$(whoami)
mytarget=$(echo I am user $myname | md5sum | cut -d ' ' -f 1)

echo "Copying passwordfile /etc/bandit_pass/$myname to /tmp/$mytarget"

cat /etc/bandit_pass/$myname > /tmp/$mytarget

```

Let's understand how this script works :

1. The variable `myname` is assigned the value of the current user's username, obtained using the `whoami` command.

2. The variable `mytarget` is assigned a unique identifier by taking the string "I am user <username>" (using the value stored in "myname"), hashing it using the md5sum command, and extracting the hash value using the "cut" command.

3. A message is printed to the console indicating that a password file is being copied from "/etc/bandit_pass/<username>" to "/tmp/<hash>".

4. The password file for the current user is copied from "/etc/bandit_pass/<username>" to a file in the "/tmp" directory with a name based on the hash value obtained in step 2.

With that being said, our goal here is to get the filename that has the password. A very simple way of doing that is replicating the value of `mytarget` but using `bandit23` instead of `$myname`

```bash
bandit22@bandit:/usr/bin$ echo "I am user bandit23" | md5sum | cut -d ' ' -f 1
8ca319486bfbbc3663ea0fbe81326349 #filename
bandit22@bandit:/usr/bin$ cat /tmp/8ca319486bfbbc3663ea0fbe81326349
QYw0Y2aiA672PsMmh9puTQuhoz8SyR2G

```

We got our password ðŸ˜ƒ

> QYw0Y2aiA672PsMmh9puTQuhoz8SyR2G

## Level 23 --> 24

### Level credentials

- username : **<span style="color : #277BE9">bandit23</span>**
- password : **<span style="color : #277BE9">QYw0Y2aiA672PsMmh9puTQuhoz8SyR2G</span>**

### Level goal

A program is running automatically at regular intervals from cron, the time-based job scheduler. Look in /etc/cron.d/ for the configuration and see what command is being executed.

**NOTE**: This level requires you to create your own first shell-script. This is a very big step and you should be proud of yourself when you beat this level!

**NOTE 2**: Keep in mind that your shell script is removed once executed, so you may want to keep a copy aroundâ€¦

### Level solution

Another cron challenge, let's follow our routine.

```bash
bandit23@bandit:~$ cd /etc/cron.d
bandit23@bandit:/etc/cron.d$ ls -lhis
total 36K
67634 4.0K -rw-r--r-- 1 root root  62 Feb 21 22:02 cronjob_bandit15_root
76629 4.0K -rw-r--r-- 1 root root  62 Feb 21 22:02 cronjob_bandit17_root
76634 4.0K -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 120 Feb 21 22:03 cronjob_bandit22
76637 4.0K -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 122 Feb 21 22:03 cronjob_bandit23
76640 4.0K -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 120 Feb 21 22:03 cronjob_bandit24
76652 4.0K -rw-r--r-- 1 root root  62 Feb 21 22:03 cronjob_bandit25_root
  269 4.0K -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 201 Jan  8  2022 e2scrub_all
76677 4.0K -rwx------ 1 root root  52 Feb 21 22:04 otw-tmp-dir
75621 4.0K -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 396 Feb  2  2021 sysstat
bandit23@bandit:/etc/cron.d$ cat cronjob_bandit24
@reboot bandit24 /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit24.sh &> /dev/null
* * * * * bandit24 /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit24.sh &> /dev/null
bandit23@bandit:/etc/cron.d$ cat /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit24.sh
#!/bin/bash

myname=$(whoami)

cd /var/spool/$myname/foo
echo "Executing and deleting all scripts in /var/spool/$myname/foo:"
for i in * .*;
do
    if [ "$i" != "." -a "$i" != ".." ];
    then
        echo "Handling $i"
        owner="$(stat --format "%U" ./$i)"
        if [ "${owner}" = "bandit23" ]; then
            timeout -s 9 60 ./$i
        fi
        rm -f ./$i
    fi
done

```

Another script ? that's what we like ðŸ˜ƒ

Now let's be honest, at first glance this looks intimidating, but it's nothing to be afraid of. Let's tackle the script little by little.

> Keep in mind that the script is being run automatically every minute by `bandit24`, meaning $myname is literally `bandit24`

The first thing the script does is changing directory to `/var/spool/bandit24/foo.

It then loops through all the files, if the owner of the file is `bandit23`, it executes it with a timeout of 60s preventing infinite loops.

Finally it removes the script and repeats the operation again for all the existing files.

Well, THE TIME HAS COME, we are going to create a simple script under `/var/spool/bandit24/foo`.

```bash
bandit23@bandit:~$ cd /var/spool/bandit24/
bandit23@bandit:/var/spool/bandit24$ ls -lhisa
total 12K
526632 4.0K dr-xr-x---  3 bandit24 bandit23 4.0K Feb 21 22:03 .
 80928 4.0K drwxr-xr-x  5 root     root     4.0K Feb 21 22:03 ..
526633 4.0K drwxrwx-wx 19 root     bandit24 4.0K Apr 21 16:27 foo
```

Notice that we can write and `cd` to `foo`, but we cannot read (`ls`) its content.

```bash
bandit23@bandit:/var/spool/bandit24$ cd foo/
```

Our script will simply consist of copying the password to a file we can read.

Open your favorite text editor, which is `vim` obviously, and write your script.

```bash
bandit23@bandit:/var/spool/bandit24/foo$ vim myscript
bandit23@bandit:/var/spool/bandit24/foo$ chmod +x myscript
bandit23@bandit:/var/spool/bandit24/foo$ cat myscript
#!/bin/bash

cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit24 > /tmp/yariss

```

Let's wait for few seconds, and then check `/tmp/yariss` content.

```bash
bandit23@bandit:/var/spool/bandit24/foo$ cat /tmp/yariss
VAfGXJ1PBSsPSnvsjI8p759leLZ9GGar # et voila :)
```

We got our password ðŸ˜ƒ

> VAfGXJ1PBSsPSnvsjI8p759leLZ9GGar

## Level 24 --> 25

### Level credentials

- username : **<span style="color : #277BE9">bandit24</span>**
- password : **<span style="color : #277BE9">VAfGXJ1PBSsPSnvsjI8p759leLZ9GGar</span>**

### Level goal

A daemon is listening on port 30002 and will give you the password for bandit25 if given the password for bandit24 and a secret numeric 4-digit pincode. There is no way to retrieve the pincode except by going through all of the 10000 combinations, called brute-forcing.
You do not need to create new connections each time

### Level solution

We have been told that a deamon ðŸ˜ˆ is listening on port 30002.

Let's try to connect to it and see what is up.

```bash
bandit24@bandit:~$ nc localhost 30002
I am the pincode checker for user bandit25. Please enter the password for user bandit24 and the secret pincode on a single line, separated by a space.
```

Hmm, let's experiment with the input a little, see how the server responds.

```bash
bandit24@bandit:~$ nc localhost 30002
I am the pincode checker for user bandit25. Please enter the password for user bandit24 and the secret pincode on a single line, separated by a space.
efrefdv
Fail! You did not supply enough data. Try again.
VAfGXJ1PBSsPSnvsjI8p759leLZ9GGar 0000
Wrong! Please enter the correct pincode. Try again.
Timeout. Exiting.
```

Okey, What do you think ? Should we go through all of the 10000 combinations by hand? Are you crazy ??

Let me introduce you to **bruteforcing**.

**Bruteforcing** is a hacking technique that involves trying every possible combination of characters until a correct password is found. It's like trying to break into a safe by testing every possible combination of the lock until it clicks open. The problem is that there are usually a lot of possible combinations, so it can take a long time and a lot of computing power to brute force a password successfully.

It is of course an automated process, and that's what we will be doing.

First, let's create a `bash script` that generates all combinations from `0000` up until `9999`.

```bash
bandit24@bandit:~$ rm /tmp/yariss
bandit24@bandit:~$ mkdir /tmp/yariss
bandit24@bandit:~$ cd /tmp/yariss
bandit24@bandit:/tmp/yariss$ vim bruteforce.sh
bandit24@bandit:/tmp/yariss$ chmod +x bruteforce.sh
bandit24@bandit:/tmp/yariss$ cat bruteforce.sh
#!/bin/bash

pass='VAfGXJ1PBSsPSnvsjI8p759leLZ9GGar'
for i in {0000..9999}
do
        echo $pass $i
done
```

Let's see a sample output of the script.

```bash
bandit24@bandit:/tmp/yariss$ ./bruteforce.sh | head -4
VAfGXJ1PBSsPSnvsjI8p759leLZ9GGar 0000
VAfGXJ1PBSsPSnvsjI8p759leLZ9GGar 0001
VAfGXJ1PBSsPSnvsjI8p759leLZ9GGar 0002
VAfGXJ1PBSsPSnvsjI8p759leLZ9GGar 0003
bandit24@bandit:/tmp/yariss$ ./bruteforce.sh | tail -4
VAfGXJ1PBSsPSnvsjI8p759leLZ9GGar 9996
VAfGXJ1PBSsPSnvsjI8p759leLZ9GGar 9997
VAfGXJ1PBSsPSnvsjI8p759leLZ9GGar 9998
VAfGXJ1PBSsPSnvsjI8p759leLZ9GGar 9999
```

Seems good enough, now we need to feed this as input to `nc`

```bash
bandit24@bandit:/tmp/yariss$ ./bruteforce.sh | nc localhost 30002
...
