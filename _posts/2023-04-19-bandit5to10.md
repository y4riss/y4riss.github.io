Continuing where we left of...

## Level 05 --> 06

### Level credentials

- username : **<span style="color : #277BE9">bandit5</span>**
- password : **<span style="color : #277BE9">lrIWWI6bB37kxfiCQZqUdOIYfr6eEeqR</span>**

### Level goal

The password for the next level is stored in a file somewhere under the inhere directory and has all of the following properties:

- human-readable
- 1033 bytes in size
- not executable

### Level solution

In this level, we are going to use the `find` command.
`find` allows us to search for files in a directory hierarchy.
You can read more about how `find` works using the manual _`man find`_

> *Always read the f*ing manual ðŸ˜ƒ\*

Now that we know how `find` works, we can use its options to filter out files according to our level goal.

```bash
cd inhere
find . -type f ! -executable -size 1033c 2> /dev/null
```

Explanation :

- `.` : look for files in the current directory
- `-type f` : exclude directories and only look for files
- `! -executable` : exclude executable files
- `size 1033c` : only files that are 1033 bytes long
- `2> /dev/null` : redirect errors to the BLACK WHOLE

## Level 06 --> 07

### Level credentials

- username : **<span style="color : #277BE9">bandit6</span>**
- password : **<span style="color : #277BE9">P4L4vucdmLnm8I7Vl7jG1ApGSfjYKqJU</span>**

### Level goal

The password for the next level is stored somewhere on the server and has all of the following properties:

- owned by user bandit7
- owned by group bandit6
- 33 bytes in size

### Level solution

Using our knowledge acquired from the previous levels, a simple `find` command will do the trick

```bash
find / -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33c 2> /dev/null
```

## Level 07 --> 08

### Level credentials

- username : **<span style="color : #277BE9">bandit7</span>**
- password : **<span style="color : #277BE9">z7WtoNQU2XfjmMtWA8u5rN4vzqu4v99S</span>**

### Level goal

The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt next to the word millionth

### Level solution

It's time to learn a new command ! `grep`.

`grep` searches for **PATTERNS** in the file(s) provided as arguments, and prints lines that matches that pattern.
in our case:

- PATTERN : **millionth**
- filename : `data.txt`

```bash
grep millionth data.txt
```

## Level 08 --> 09

### Level credentials

- username : **<span style="color : #277BE9">bandit8</span>**
- password : **<span style="color : #277BE9">TESKZC0XvTetK0S9xNwm25STk5iWrBvP</span>**

### Level goal

The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt and is the only line of text that occurs only once

### Level solution

If we `cat` our `data.txt` file, we will notice a lot of duplicate lines.
What we can do is :

- sort the file, so that duplicate lines are consecutive.
- filter out the file by only taking the line that appeared once

we can achieve this by piping the result of `sort data.txt` into `uniq -u`

The `-u` option will filter out all lines that appeared more than once, leaving us with the password.

```bash
sort data.txt | uniq -u
```

## Level 09 --> 10

### Level credentials

- username : **<span style="color : #277BE9">bandit9</span>**
- password : **<span style="color : #277BE9">EN632PlfYiZbn3PhVK3XOGSlNInNE00t</span>**

### Level goal

The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt in one of the few human-readable strings, preceded by several â€˜=â€™ characters.

### Level solution

`data.txt` is a data file, meaning it contains junk if we try to display its content.

A work around is to use `strings` instead of `cat`.

`strings` will print the sequence of printable characters in files.

We can then pip the result to a simple `grep`.

```bash
strings data.txt | grep "="
```
