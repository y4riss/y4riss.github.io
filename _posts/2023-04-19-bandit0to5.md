Bandit is a beginner-level wargame hosted by OverTheWire, which is designed to help users learn and practice the basic concepts of Linux command-line and security.

The game consists of a series of levels, each containing a different set of challenges that require the player to use their knowledge of Linux commands and system vulnerabilities to find passwords hidden in files or to gain access to restricted areas.

As the player progresses through the levels, the challenges become increasingly difficult, requiring more advanced techniques and deeper understanding of security concepts.

## Level 00

### Level goal

To progress to Level 1, you must successfully log in to the game through SSH.
More about SSH here : [SSH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell)

### Level solution

> _Simple enough isn't it ?_

- username : **bandit0**
- password : **bandit0**

All that's left is to connect, using port <span style="color : #fff">2220</span>

```bash
ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
```

## Level 00 --> 01

### Level credentials

- username : **<span style="color : #277BE9">bandit0</span>**
- password : **<span style="color : #277BE9">bandit0</span>**

### Level goal

To progress to the next level, locate the password within the **readme** file in the home directory. Use this password to log in to bandit1 via SSH. After discovering the password for a level, always use SSH on port **2220** to access that level and proceed with the game.

### Level solution

Well, reading the instructions, what we need to do is :

- list all of the files in our current directory

```bash
ls
```

- locate a file named **readme** and display its content

```bash
cat readme
```

## Level 01 --> 02

### Level credentials

- username : **<span style="color : #277BE9">bandit1</span>**
- password : **<span style="color : #277BE9">NH2SXQwcBdpmTEzi3bvBHMM9H66vVXjL</span>**

### Level goal

The password for the next level is stored in a file called - located in the home directory

### Level solution

This level is a bit tricky, if you trie `cat -` , it won't work,that's because `-` represents the standard input, e.g `cat` will read the input from your keyboard, and display it to the standard output.
To read the actual file, we need to provide its path.

```bash
cat ./-
```

## Level 02 --> 03

### Level credentials

- username : **<span style="color : #277BE9">bandit2</span>**
- password : **<span style="color : #277BE9">rRGizSaX8Mk1RTb1CNQoXTcYZWU6lgzi</span>**

### Level goal

The password for the next level is stored in a file called spaces in this filename located in the home directory

### Level solution

This level is kind of free, here is a simple methode to solve it:

- Type `cat` followed by s, then hit `tab` in your keyboard.
  > _You can also type the full name using quotes_

```bash
cat spaces\ in\ this\ filename
```

## Level 03 --> 04

### Level credentials

- username : **<span style="color : #277BE9">bandit3</span>**
- password : **<span style="color : #277BE9">aBZ0W5EmUfAf7kHTQeOwd8bauFJ2lAiG</span>**

### Level goal

The password for the next level is stored in a hidden file in the inhere directory.

### Level solution

The solution is straightforward :

- change directory to `inhere`

```bash
cd inhere
```

- list all of the files , including the hidden ones

```bash
ls -lhisa
```

- `cat` the content of the hidden file

```bash
cat .hidden
```

## Level 04 --> 05

### Level credentials

- username : **<span style="color : #277BE9">bandit4</span>**
- password : **<span style="color : #277BE9">2EW7BBsr6aMMoJ2HjW067dm8EgX26xNe</span>**

### Level goal

The password for the next level is stored in the only human-readable file in the inhere directory.

### Level solution

Ok, let's visite the `inhere` directory.

```bash
cd inhere
```

Listing the directory's content, we notice 10 files, all starting with `-` in their name.
We know that our password is stored in a unique human-readable file, we can leverage that by determining the file type of all the files.
To determine the type of a file, we can use `file <file_name>`
To determine the type of all files in a directory , we can use the wildcard `*` .
But remember, all the files start with a hyphon, we need to provide the path of the files as we saw in the previous levels.

```bash
file ./*
```

Doing so, we can clearly see that the only distinguishable file is `-file07`.

```bash
cat ./-file07
```
