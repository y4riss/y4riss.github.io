Continuing where we left of...

## Level 15 --> 16

### Level credentials

- username : **<span style="color : #277BE9">bandit15</span>**
- password : **<span style="color : #277BE9">jN2kgmIXJ6fShzhT2avhotn4Zcka6tnt</span>**

### Level goal

The password for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level to port 30001 on localhost using SSL encryption.

### Level solution

As we have seen in the previous level, `nc` allows us to exchange data between a client and a server, but in plaintext.

Meaning all data exchanged is not encrypted.

`openssl` is a command-line utility for cryptography and SSL/TLS protocols. It can be used to establish a basic network connection using the `s_client` option. Here's an example of how to use openssl as a simple network client:

```bash
openssl s_client -connect <hostname>:<port>
```

Let's try it out.

```bash
bandit15@bandit:~$ openssl s_client localhost:30001
```

Okey, the standard input is open, let's type our password.

```bash
jN2kgmIXJ6fShzhT2avhotn4Zcka6tnt
Correct!

## Level 16 --> 17

### Level credentials

- username : **<span style="color : #277BE9">bandit16</span>**
- password : **<span style="color : #277BE9">JQttfApK4SeyHwDlI9SXGR50qclOAil1</span>**

### Level goal

The credentials for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level to a port on localhost in the range 31000 to 32000. First find out which of these ports have a server listening on them. Then find out which of those speak SSL and which donâ€™t. There is only 1 server that will give the next credentials, the others will simply send back to you whatever you send to it.

### Level solution

First, we need to scan the host for open ports within the range 31000 to 32000.

Port scanning is a technique used to discover which ports on a networked device are open and listening for connections.

We can use `nmap` to scan for open ports.

```bash
# example
nmap -p <port_range> <hostname>
```

- hostname : localhost
- port range : 31000 to 32000

Let's try it !

```bash
bandit16@bandit:~$ nmap -p 31000-32000 localhost
Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2023-04-20 17:28 UTC
Nmap scan report for localhost (127.0.0.1)
Host is up (0.000094s latency).
Not shown: 996 closed ports
PORT      STATE SERVICE
31046/tcp open  unknown
31518/tcp open  unknown
31691/tcp open  unknown
31790/tcp open  unknown
31960/tcp open  unknown

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 0.06 seconds
```

We have just made a basic scan, not bad but it doesn't provide us with much information other than the actual open ports.

Let's now detecte services using the `-sV` option.

```bash
bandit16@bandit:~$  nmap -sV -p 31000-32000 localhost
...
PORT      STATE SERVICE     REASON  VERSION
31046/tcp open  echo        syn-ack
31518/tcp open  ssl/echo    syn-ack
31691/tcp open  echo        syn-ack
31790/tcp open  ssl/unknown syn-ack
31960/tcp open  echo        syn-ack
...
```

Hmmm, we've got 2 ports that use ssl, but one of them has the `echo` service , which will just print what it gets as input.

With that said, the promising port is `31790`.

Let's use our skills aquiered from the previous level to connect to it using `openssl` !

```bash
bandit16@bandit:~$ openssl s_client localhost:31790
...

We got our ssh key ðŸ˜ƒ

## Level 17 --> 18

### Level credentials

- username : **<span style="color : #277BE9">bandit18</span>**
- password : **<span style="color : #277BE9">SSH key from the previous level</span>**

### Level goal

There are 2 files in the homedirectory: passwords.old and passwords.new. The password for the next level is in passwords.new and is the only line that has been changed between passwords.old and passwords.new

### Level solution

This level is pretty straight forward. We are going to be using `diff`.

`diff` is a command-line utility used for comparing two files or directories and showing the differences between them.

```bash
bandit17@bandit:~$ ls
passwords.new  passwords.old
bandit17@bandit:~$ diff passwords.old passwords.new

> hga5tuuCLF6fFzUpnagiMN8ssu9LFrdg
```

We got our password ðŸ˜ƒ

> hga5tuuCLF6fFzUpnagiMN8ssu9LFrdg

## Level 18 --> 19

### Level credentials

- username : **<span style="color : #277BE9">bandit18</span>**
- password : **<span style="color : #277BE9">hga5tuuCLF6fFzUpnagiMN8ssu9LFrdg</span>**

### Level goal

The password for the next level is stored in a file readme in the homedirectory. Unfortunately, someone has modified .bashrc to log you out when you log in with SSH.

### Level solution

This is fun !

When we try to log in, we get disconnected immediately. How can we possibly solve the challenge if we can't even connect to it ??

Now, what you need to understand is when you log in to a linux session, the default behavior is to execute your login shell, which will read your .bashrc file.

In our case, `.bashrc` has a script that makes us disconnect.

Now you are wondering if we can log in without loading `.bashrc`. Yes we can and here is how :

```bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(yarissã‰¿Kali-VM)-[~]
â””â”€$ ssh -t bandit18@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220  bash --noprofile --norc
```

<span style="color : #f92672">Explanation</span>

The `-t` option forces the allocation of a pseudo-tty, which is required for an interactive shell. The `--noprofile` and `--norc` options tell bash not to read the system-wide or user-specific initialization files, respectively.

Now we have a terminal, we can read `readme`.

```bash
bash-5.1$ cat readme
awhqfNnAbc1naukrpqDYcF95h7HoMTrC
```

Out of curiosity, let's see what the content of `.bashrc` is

```bash
bash-5.1$ cat .bashrc
...
echo 'Byebye !'
exit 0
```

Haa ! `exit 0` is the evil command that was forcing us to disconnect, good to know !

We got our password ðŸ˜ƒ

> awhqfNnAbc1naukrpqDYcF95h7HoMTrC

## Level 19 --> 20

### Level credentials

- username : **<span style="color : #277BE9">bandit19</span>**
- password : **<span style="color : #277BE9">awhqfNnAbc1naukrpqDYcF95h7HoMTrC</span>**

### Level goal

To gain access to the next level, you should use the setuid binary in the homedirectory. Execute it without arguments to find out how to use it. The password for this level can be found in the usual place (/etc/bandit_pass), after you have used the setuid binary.

### Level solution

SUID (Set User ID) is a special permission bit that can be set on executable files in Unix/Linux file systems. When a file with the SUID bit is executed, it runs with the permissions of the file's owner, rather than the permissions of the user who is executing the file. This allows users to execute certain programs with elevated privileges, even if they do not have the necessary permissions themselves.

```bash
bandit19@bandit:~$ ls
bandit20-do
bandit19@bandit:~$ ls -l bandit20-do
-rwsr-x--- 1 bandit20 bandit19 14876 Feb 21 22:03 bandit20-do
```

In our case, the owner of the binary is bandit20, and has the SUID bit set, meaning that we can execute it as if we were bandit20.

Now what does this binary do exactly ? Let's execute it to find out.

```bash
bandit19@bandit:~$ ./bandit20-do
Run a command as another user.
  Example: ./bandit20-do id
```

Hmm, let's try the example

```bash
bandit19@bandit:~$ ./bandit20-do id
uid=11019(bandit19) gid=11019(bandit19) euid=11020(bandit20) groups=11019(bandit19)
bandit19@bandit:~$ id
uid=11019(bandit19) gid=11019(bandit19) groups=11019(bandit19)
```

We can notice something strange, our `euid` is `bandit20`.

EUID stands for Effective User ID. When a program is executed with the SUID bit set, the EUID of the process is set to the owner of the program, rather than the user who is executing the program.

How can we leverage that ? We can try to execute `cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit20` using `bandit20-do`, since our euid will be the same as the file's owner (bandit20).

```bash
bandit19@bandit:~$ ./bandit20-do cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit20
VxCazJaVykI6W36BkBU0mJTCM8rR95XT
